        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly oil grill& heat BBQ to medium.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg in a bowl& add next 6 ingredients.</li>
            <li>Add any of the “stir-ins” that appeal to you.</li>
            <li>Crumble in beef& using your hands or a fork, gently mix together.</li>
            <li>Handle the meat as little as possible 
                (the more you work it, the tougher it gets)</li>
            <li>Gently shape (don't firmly press) mixture into burgers about ¾ inch 
                thick.</li>
            <li>Using your thumb, make a shallow depression in the centre of each 
                burger to prevent puffing up during cooking.</li>
            <li>Place burgers on the grill, close lid& BBQ until NO LONGER PINK INSIDE, 
                turning once, about 6 - 8 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>An instant read thermometer should read 160F.</li>
            <li>Don't abuse your burgers by pressing with a spatula, pricking with a fork 
                or turning frequently as precious juices will be lost!</li>
            <li>Tuck into a warm crusty bun& add your favourite toppings.</li>
        </ol>
